// A variable is a container for storing data
// A variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains

// Two steps:
// 1. Declaration(var,let,const)
// 2. Assignment(= assignment operator)

let firstName = "Akshata"; //strings
let age = 21; //numbers
let student = true; //booleans


console.log("Hello", firstName);
console.log("You are",age,"years old");
console.log("Enrolled:", student);
